   abstract = {Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is the term used to describe the use of computers and technology to simulate intelligent behavior and critical thinking comparable to a human being. John McCarthy first described the term AI in 1956 as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines. Objective This descriptive article gives a broad overview of AI in medicine, dealing with the terms and concepts as well as the current and future applications of AI. It aims to develop knowledge and familiarity of AI among primary care physicians. Materials and Methods PubMed and Google searches were performed using the key words 'artificial intelligence'. Further references were obtained by cross-referencing the key articles. Results Recent advances in AI technology and its current applications in the field of medicine have been discussed in detail. Conclusions AI promises to change the practice of medicine in hitherto unknown ways, but many of its practical applications are still in their infancy and need to be explored and developed better. Medical professionals also need to understand and acclimatize themselves with these advances for better healthcare delivery to the masses.},
